# Overview

A random dungeon generator built as the final project in the UC Berkeley course CS61B.

# Implementation of Procedural World Generation

TBD

# Running

On starting a new game, you will be prompted to enter a numeric value. This will be used to seed the
random number generator that powers elements of the procedural generation algorithm.

Subsequently you will see an animation of the level being generated that represents a visualisation
of the algorithm steps. The animation can be disabled within the settings menu before starting a
new game to speed up the level load process significantly.

The main objective I had was to understand procedural generation. Therefore, gameplay itself is
limited and simply allows the player to move a chicken avatar around the level, eating randomly
placed pieces of corn. 

Controls:

':' - Menu
'w' - Move up
'a' - Move left
's' - Move down
'd' - Move right

The algorithm implementation was inspired by the description in this blog post from Bob Nystrom:
